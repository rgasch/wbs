 * The goal is simple.
 * Make all the Tests pass while you follow this rule set:

 * - Use this git repository
 * - Commit every single step you make
 * - Do not alter the "MakeMePassTest.php" file
 * - Use and follow the composer.json
 * - Use object orientation
 * - Follow the DRY principle - again: follow the DRY principle! :-)
 * - Follow the SOLID principles, when suitable
 * - Code as elegantly and beautifully as possible
 * - At least follow PSR-2 standards
 * - And KISS - if we don't understand your code, we won't hire you :-)
 *
 * When you are done, satisfied and proud of your work,
 * please wrap the git repository in a ZIP file (don't forget the last commit)
 * and send it along with a nice E-Mail with some details about you back to us.

 * Good Luck !
